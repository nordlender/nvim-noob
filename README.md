My nvim config. Has an epic vimtex setup

# Features
- Epic Latex editing, with easy to add snippets, and remapped jk keys for long wrapped lines
- Kind of buggy but still epic statusline color change for each window (visual feedback for the impaired)
- Disabled arrow keys for the ill mannered
- Epic mappings such as CTRL-L for window cycle, CTRL-J and K for scroll, etc

# Todo
- Add some nice autoexpanding lua snippets (oneline if, for etc)
- More visual feedback for window switch autocmd (WindowSTLine)
- Make winSTline friendlier with existing stline plugin
- Make winSTline not react to completion popup 
- Tidy up
